\section{Acknowledgments}\label{sec:acknowledgments}
This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.
In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.
